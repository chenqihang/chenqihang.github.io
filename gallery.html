                <h3> University Garden</h3>
                <p>This is a screenshot of the University Garden. After a downpour last night, the trees in the University Garden are glowing under the sunshine. The University Garden is a forest reservation, where most students and local families are willing to take a walk or spend their spare time on weekends. The natural atmosphere of peace take away people’s stress and isolate them from their busy daily life.</p>

                <h3>Bench In The Woods</h3>
                <p>There are several benches in the garden for tourists when they get tired. Usually people prefer to lying on the ground rather than sitting on the benches. However, people can have a better view of the nearby scenes when they are sitting on the bench and surrounded by the trees with glowing green leaves.</p>

                <h3>Tag On The Three</h3> 
                <p>A strip of cloth is tied to a tree’s trunk. The gardeners use it for marking the perimeter of trees growth rings. Gardeners also try to trace the life circle of the trees to guarantee that they are in the good status.</p>

                <p>This is a close-up of a white flower. The tiny wild white flowers already have withered away at the end of March. This wild flowers can be seen everywhere in the bushes. The springtime in Gainesville starts early and ends early.</p>

                <h3>Swimming Fish</h3>
                <p>Three fish swim from the underwater to the surface to capture insects. People will find there is a river flowing into the deep woods when they are leaving. They cannot recognize it once they step in the garden because it is hidden under the thick grass.</p>
